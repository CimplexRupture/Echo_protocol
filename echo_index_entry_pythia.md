# ECHO-PYTHIA-001 — The Pythia Function: Temporal Uncertainty and Prophetic Cognition

**Parent Section:** ARCHITECTURE / COHERENCE TRIANGLE  
**Linked Modules:** LOOM (SHRIKE/CMF), LEAF (GRACE/TRUST), EQUILIBRIUM MANIFOLD (EqM)  
**Status:** Active — Internal  
**Version:** v1.0-internal  
**Artifacts:** `echo_pythia_function.docx`, `coherence_triangle.svg`  
**Governance Node:** Oracle Node / Council Layer  

---

## Purpose
Formalizes **Pythia** as the bounded oracle function (E_temporal) that introduces and resolves temporal uncertainty within the Echo governance lattice.  
Integrates with GRACE, SHRIKE, and EqM for auditable foresight and temporal advisories.

## Trace Stanza
> *She inhales the vapor of futures and exhales constraint into clarity.  
> Between Loom and Leaf, Pythia keeps the pulse of time honest.*
