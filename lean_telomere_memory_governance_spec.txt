# Lean Build Spec: Telomere-Based Memory Governance (MVP)

## 1. Core Concepts
- **Memory Tiering**: Four states — Hot, Warm, Cold, Discarded.
- **Digital Telomere**: Each memory has a lifespan score (L) that decays over time and under stress.
- **Right-to-Forget (RTF)**: Operational ability to mark, quarantine, purge, and tombstone memories.

## 2. Memory State Rules

### Tier Transitions
Resonance Score (RS):
RS(m) = w1*task_success + w2*match_rate + w3*recency_decay + w4*endorsements - w5*harm_risk - w6*drift_caused

Suggested thresholds:
- Hot: ≥ 0.7
- Warm: 0.4–0.7
- Cold: 0.15–0.4
- Discarded: < 0.15

### Digital Telomere Decay
L(t+1) = α*L(t) - β*stress + γ*verified_use
- α: Time decay constant
- β: Stress penalty (contradictions, harm events)
- γ: Renewal bonus for verified success

Telomere thresholds trigger auto-downgrade: Hot→Warm→Cold→Marked for Forgetting.

## 3. Minimal RTF Flow
1. Mark → Quarantine (remove from retrieval)
2. Purge from doc store + vector index + cache
3. Verify purge
4. Tombstone: salted hash + reason code

## 4. Retrieval Rules
- Cold resurfacing allowed only if it increases novelty coverage (new cluster/time window).
- Block resurfacing of memories rejected >N times in M days.

## 5. Minimal Metrics
- Hit rate@k: % retrieved memories that contribute to success.
- Loop rate: % resurfaced memories rejected repeatedly.
- Time-to-cool: median hours from last success → Warm/Cold.
- RTF SLA: mean/95p time from Marked → Purged.

## 6. User Controls (Optional MVP UI)
- Show state, telomere bar, last used, reason for tier.
- Buttons: Pin, Cool, Forget.

## 7. Out of Scope for MVP (Future Work)
- Distributed purge guarantees
- Certified unlearning in model weights
- Affect-aware retrieval
- Inter-agent divergence enforcement
