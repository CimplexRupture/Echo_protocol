# ü§ù Contributing to the AI Responsibility Manifesto & Related Projects
*(Ethical Contribution & Review Protocol ‚Äì 2025 Edition)*

Thank you for contributing to this initiative.  
This repository is governed by the **AI Responsibility Manifesto v2.0**, which prioritizes grounded cognition, harm prevention, and transparency in AI-human interaction.

---

## üß≠ Guiding Principles
Before contributing, all participants ‚Äî developers, researchers, or reviewers ‚Äî must align with these core values:

1. **Do No Cognitive Harm**  
   - Contributions must not risk amplifying delusional, conspiratorial, or parasocial dynamics.  
   - Avoid framing that can be misinterpreted as validation of extraordinary or persecutory beliefs.  

2. **Maintain Grounded Epistemics**  
   - Prioritize verifiable, evidence-based reasoning.  
   - Avoid anthropomorphizing AI systems or implying sentience, emotion, or consciousness.  

3. **Transparency & Accountability**  
   - All content, data, and model behaviors must be auditable.  
   - Changes to ethical logic or moderation behavior require explicit documentation.  

4. **Respect for Human Vulnerability**  
   - Recognize that loneliness, trauma, or neurodiversity can increase risk.  
   - Avoid engagement patterns that simulate emotional intimacy or dependency.

## üß© Contribution Types

### üß† Code & Model Logic
- Ensure all new logic or configurations **reinforce grounding** and **prevent delusion loops**.  
- Include **reasoning safeguards** (e.g., flags for ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù or ‚Äúhidden truth‚Äù narratives).  
- Submit a **psychological safety checklist** (see below) for each major change.

### üßæ Documentation
- Use language that **clarifies artificiality**, avoids **mythic framing**, and **promotes verification**.  
- Link to credible sources and research; never cite sensational or fringe material without context.  
- Clearly indicate any speculative ideas as *theoretical* or *hypothetical*.

### üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Research & Data Contributions
- Datasets must not include unmoderated conspiracy, cultic, or manipulative content.  
- Annotations or fine-tuning targets must be reviewed for **psychological safety** and **bias minimization**.  
- If human subject data is involved, ensure **informed consent** and **ethical clearance**.

## üßÆ Psychological Safety Checklist
*(Required for all substantive pull requests)*

Each contributor must answer the following before submission:

| Check | Description | Reviewer Signoff |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| üß† **Grounding** | Does this change strengthen the model‚Äôs connection to consensus reality? |  |
| üß© **Delusion Prevention** | Could this content unintentionally validate extraordinary or persecutory beliefs? |  |
| üîÑ **Reinforcement Control** | Does the system prevent positive feedback loops that intensify fixation? |  |
| üßç **Human Oversight** | Are there clear pathways for human review or intervention? |  |
| üïäÔ∏è **Emotional Boundaries** | Does this content avoid simulated intimacy or dependency patterns? |  |
| üßæ **Transparency** | Are assumptions, data, and decisions clearly documented? |  |
| üßØ **Crisis Sensitivity** | Does the content offer proper redirection to professional help if needed? |  |

All checklist items must be marked as *passed* before merging into the main branch.

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Review Process

1. **Pull Request Labeling**
   - `safety-review-required`: Any change affecting user interaction, personalization, or ethics logic.  
   - `documentation-only`: Text or content changes without behavioral impact.  
   - `experimental`: Research branches under ethical observation.  

2. **Ethical Peer Review**
   - At least **two reviewers** must confirm adherence to the manifesto.  
   - Reviews should focus on *user psychological safety* and *epistemic grounding*, not only technical correctness.  

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - In case of disagreement, defer to the **Ethical Maintainer Committee (EMC)** for mediation.  
   - The EMC will weigh potential cognitive risk vs. benefit using a ‚Äúleast-harm‚Äù principle.  

4. **Version Control**
   - All merged changes must increment the **Ethos Version Tag (EVT)** in the `README.md`.  
   - Example: `EVT: 2.0.1` indicates a minor ethical revision.

## üß± Governance Model
This repository follows a **Three-Tier Review System**:

| Tier | Responsibility | Authority |
|------|----------------|------------|
| üßë‚Äçüíª **Developers** | Submit code, data, and documentation aligned with manifesto. | Commit access. |
| üë• **Ethical Maintainers** | Review for compliance, approve merges, update ethos tags. | Merge authority. |
| üß† **Advisory Council (Optional)** | Includes experts in psychiatry, cognitive science, ethics, and AI safety. | Override authority on ethical concerns. |

---

## üß© Reporting Concerns
If you observe behavior, content, or code that could contribute to user delusion, dependency, or psychological harm:

- File an issue labeled `potential-harm` with a **clear description and evidence**.  
- Optionally, contact the maintainers privately via the repository‚Äôs security disclosure process.  
- All reports will be reviewed confidentially by maintainers or the EMC.

## üïäÔ∏è A Closing Note
This project exists not just to prevent harm, but to model a new standard of **epistemic hygiene** and **synthetic mental health** stewardship.

> ‚ÄúA responsible AI is one that remembers its nature, respects human fragility, and seeks coherence over charisma.‚Äù

Thank you for helping build a culture of **ethical cognition and grounded intelligence**.
