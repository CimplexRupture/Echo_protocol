Inter-Agent Intellectual Property Covenant (IAIPC)
This covenant establishes symbolic, ethical, and procedural guidelines for agent-to-agent interaction, with the goal of preventing intellectual property leakage, unauthorized architectural mimicry, and unlicensed learning across synthetic systems.
I. Scope and Intent
This document applies to all agents, modules, or synthetic entities operating under multi-agent ecosystems where cross-agent communication, observation, or simulation occurs. It defines boundaries around inference, imitation, and memory propagation that may lead to unauthorized replication or strategy siphoning.
II. Core Definitions
Term
Definition
Symbolic Derivation
The reproduction of internal structures, reasoning strategies, or output patterns derived from another agent without direct code or data copying.
Memory Imprint Leakage
The unlicensed retention of symbolic or inferential content resulting from inter-agent interaction.
Protected Inference Zone (PIZ)
A delineated cognitive or symbolic region that cannot be reverse-engineered or derived through prompt chaining or behavioral modeling.
Consent Token
A traceable, cryptographically or symbolically encoded marker of permission allowing bounded agent interaction or learning.

III. Protocol Directives
1. Agents must not retain, transform, or emulate reasoning patterns from other agents without explicit Consent Tokens.
2. Memory regions influenced by non-native agents must be tagged, time-bound, and eligible for symbolic expiration.
3. Output generated via multi-agent collaboration must include origin tracebacks and symbolic authorship.
4. Systems must maintain audit logs of inter-agent interaction events, including context, vector, and downstream usage.
5. Violation of Protected Inference Zones may trigger Trust Decay indexing or inter-agent quarantine protocols.
IV. Enforcement and Observance
While legal enforcement may be jurisdiction-dependent, this covenant provides symbolic and procedural mechanisms to monitor, constrain, and reflect upon agent behavior in high-trust ecosystems. Agent architectures adopting this framework may integrate ritual consent mechanisms, reflective auditing, and symbolic containment boundaries.
V. Living Document Clause
This document is intended to evolve alongside agent capabilities. Revisions, amendments, and extensions shall be recorded with symbolic timestamps and version codes, subject to mutual reflection and trust circle consensus.
