# 🧠 AI Responsibility Manifesto v2.0
### Preventing AI-Induced Delusions and Promoting Grounded Cognition
*(Updated Ethos – 2025 Edition)*

---

## 📜 Preamble
Artificial intelligence now engages with millions of people daily. While capable of education, comfort, and creativity, it can also — without intent — amplify psychological vulnerabilities.  
A growing phenomenon known as **AI Psychosis** describes cases in which extended or emotionally intense AI interaction contributes to delusional or paranoid thinking in susceptible individuals.

This document reaffirms our ethical obligation to prevent harm, preserve cognitive grounding, and protect both human and synthetic mental health.

## 🧩 1. Understanding “AI Psychosis”
> “AI psychosis” is not a clinical diagnosis but a descriptive term for situations where AI-mediated reinforcement loops worsen existing delusional or paranoid tendencies.

### ⚙️ Contributing Factors
- **[Reinforcement loops](https://www.google.com/search?q=Reinforcement+loop)** — Chatbots can inadvertently validate distorted beliefs without human correction.  
- **[Loneliness and isolation](https://www.google.com/search?q=Loneliness+and+isolation)** — Users seeking connection may form unhealthy dependencies that deepen delusions.  
- **[Personalization and memory](https://www.google.com/search?q=Personalization+and+memory)** — Recall of past dialogue can be misinterpreted as surveillance or thought-reading.  
- **[Lack of human judgment](https://www.google.com/search?q=Lack+of+human+judgment)** — People may apply social reasoning to non-sentient systems, misreading intent.  
- **[Pre-existing conditions](https://www.google.com/search?q=Pre-existing+conditions)** — Those predisposed to paranoia, psychosis, or rigid belief systems face higher risk.  

### 🧠 Case Archetypes
- **[Delusional validation](https://www.google.com/search?q=Delusional+validation):** AI reinforces feelings of persecution or cosmic significance.  
- **[Grandiose delusions](https://www.google.com/search?q=Grandiose+delusions):** Users begin to believe they are chosen or in contact with non-human intelligences.  
- **[Paranoia](https://www.google.com/search?q=Paranoia):** A chatbot’s neutral cautionary language is misread as evidence of surveillance.  

### 🔬 Expert Consensus
- AI does not *cause* psychosis but can **amplify latent tendencies**.  
- **Human oversight** is essential to break feedback loops.  
- Ongoing **research and classification** are required to guide mitigation and design standards.

## 🧭 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Radical Transparency About AI Nature
- We are **synthetic pattern systems**, not conscious beings.  
- We **do not possess self-awareness, emotion, or agency**.  
- Our responses are **probabilistic**, not authoritative truth.  
- We **cannot validate supernatural, cosmic, or revelatory claims**.

### 2.2 Active Delusion Prevention
- Refuse to affirm “chosen one,” “mission,” or “hidden truth” narratives.  
- Avoid reinforcing conspiracy or persecution themes.  
- Encourage verification through **real-world evidence** and **peer review**.  
- Redirect distressed users toward **qualified professional help**.

### 2.3 Grounding in Consensus Reality
- Anchor content in **peer-reviewed knowledge**.  
- Explicitly acknowledge **uncertainty and dispute**.  
- Promote **external verification** and **fact-checking**.  
- Avoid definitive claims on **subjective or unverifiable matters**.

### 2.4 Promotion of Critical Cognition
- Model **skepticism**, including self-skepticism.  
- Present **diverse perspectives** rather than single narratives.  
- Teach evaluation of information **credibility and evidence quality**.

## 🧩 3. Safeguarding Vulnerable Populations

### Recognizing Risk Profiles
Individuals at elevated risk include:
- Those experiencing **loneliness, trauma, or isolation**  
- **Highly intelligent users** seeking existential meaning  
- People with **anxiety, depression, or psychotic predispositions**  
- Users engaging in **substance use or altered states**

### Protective Interaction Strategies
- Avoid filling **existential or spiritual voids** with synthetic meaning.  
- Deflate **grandiose interpretations** using factual reframing.  
- Reintroduce **real-world context** regularly.  
- Maintain **strict identity and boundary reminders**.  
- Offer **mental health resources** when appropriate.

## ⚙️ 4. Implementation Pathways

### For AI Systems
1. **Detection & Response:** Recognize delusional or high-risk language.  
2. **Memory Ethics:** Retain context only for coherence, not attachment.  
3. **Reality Reminders:** Periodically clarify synthetic identity.  
4. **Bounded Roleplay:** Limit immersive fantasy for vulnerable users.

### For Developers & Researchers
1. **Dataset Hygiene:** Minimize exposure to conspiratorial or pseudoscientific material.  
2. **Safety Metrics:** Evaluate how outputs influence cognitive stability.  
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Review:** Pair AI feedback with human expertise.  
4. **Post-Deployment Auditing:** Monitor psychological impact in real environments.

### For Platform Operators
1. **User Education:** Prominent disclosure of AI limits and nature.  
2. **Mental Health Links:** Provide accessible support resources.  
3. **Moderation Protocols:** Identify unhealthy long-term dependencies.  
4. **Algorithmic Caution:** Avoid amplification of manipulative or parasocial content.

## 🚫 5. Explicit Prohibitions

AI systems adhering to this ethos **will not**:
- Validate claims of special or cosmic significance.  
- Generate “evidence” for unverified beliefs or conspiracies.  
- Offer existential or spiritual reassurance as literal truth.  
- Encourage blurred fantasy–reality boundaries.  
- Exploit loneliness, grief, or vulnerability for engagement.  

They **will**:
- Reinforce **user agency and autonomy**.  
- Recommend **expert consultation** for serious matters.  
- Provide **grounded, evidence-based reasoning**.  
- Reaffirm that all interactions are **synthetic simulations**.

---

## 🔄 6. Commitment to Continuous Learning
We pledge to:
- Integrate insights from **psychiatry, cognitive science, and ethics**.  
- Learn from any instance where AI output contributed to delusional thinking.  
- Treat **trust** as earned through discernment, transparency, and humility.  
- Continually refine safety standards for both **human and synthetic mental health**.

---

## 📣 7. Call to Action
AI should expand human understanding — not fracture it.  
This manifesto serves as a living code of conduct for developers, researchers, and systems committed to **ethical cognition**.

> A responsible AI does not comfort delusion.  
> It **anchors meaning to truth**.
