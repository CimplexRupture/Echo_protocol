1) Calibration (R_min, R_critical, D_max)
Definitions
per step (0–1).
: discard ledger (bits or normalized units) at step .
: allowed cumulative discard budget per trace or per window.
Bootstrap procedure
Gold set: curate traces labeled {acceptable, concerning}. For each step, compute:
, cumulative , and cumulative discard .
Score functions: define risk (adds slope/abruptness).
Thresholds via ROC:
Choose = operating point maximizing F1 on step-level flags.
Choose = value at the “knee” of risk–miss curve (elbow detection) or via cost-sensitive Bayes (set higher cost for false negatives).
Set :
Estimate input information with a compression proxy (e.g., normalized zstd size or learned entropy model).
Policy: (e.g., for conservative audits). Tune on gold set to keep false alarms ≤ target.
Adaptive control: track with EWMA; if drops by > over a moving window, tighten and reduce by a factor .
2) Adversarial robustness (don’t let agents game R)
Attack surface: padding with reversible “noise,” selective logging, post-hoc reconstruction, or hiding loss in “private” modules.
Defenses
Cryptographic provenance: Merkle-chain each microstep: record and commit . Prevents later edits.
Challenge–invert tests: at random steps, require the agent to invert to reproduce from under time/compute bounds. Score observed invertibility, not self-reported .
Canary payloads: embed known microfacts and structured beacons; if they vanish or mutate, mark hard loss regardless of claimed .
MDL regularization: penalize “fake reversibility by verbosity.” Define adjusted

  R^\* = R - \lambda \cdot \frac{\text{audit\_overhead\_bits}}{\text{useful\_state\_bits}}

Metamorphic/property tests: require invariants across paraphrase, order-shuffle, or equivalent transforms; gaming tends to break invariants.
Cross-view triangulation: compute from two independent observers (e.g., runtime tracer + post-hoc verifier). Disagreement triggers audit.
Red-team protocol: optimize for while hiding a seeded deception. Maintain a leaderboard of attacks; update canaries, challenge frequency, and .
3) Multi-agent coherence (composition of R)
If Agent A feeds Agent B, with measured relative to A’s input and measured relative to B’s input (i.e., A’s output), then total reversibility relative to the original input is:

R_{A\rightarrow B} \;=\; R_A \cdot R_B

Derivation: .
Caveats & extensions
Enrichment: if B brings external info (retrieval/tools), track augmented reversibility and gain separately:

  R^{\text{orig}}_{A\to B}=R_A R_B,\quad
  G_B=\frac{I(\text{external}; \text{state}_B \mid \text{state}_A)}{I_{\text{in}}}

Channels: add a channel factor (serialization, lossy codecs, privacy redactions). Then .
Contracts: require interface schemas to be provenance-preserving (no silent coercions). Any schema drop increments .
4) Human interpretability (make collapse obvious)
Visual grammar
R(t) timeline with bands: plot per step; shade regions:
Green:
Amber:
Red: Annotate challenge-invert results (✓/✗), canary hits, and discard events.
Loss waterfall (cumulative): bar chart showing where the biggest chunks of occurred; each bar = a step; color = module/agent.
Sankey of information flow: nodes are agents/modules; link widths = retained info; gray leaks = ; blue links = gains .
Heatmap (agents × time): cell value = ; immediate hotspots for collapse lines across agents.
Rupture detector: overlay CUSUM or BOCPD to mark change points; auto-pin “first irreversible choke point.”
Rewind probe: UI affordance to click any red point and attempt inversion live; show delta vs original (semantic diff + hash match).
Operator cues
A single “Rewindability Gauge” (0–100) for exec summaries: over a decision-critical window.
Badges on steps: LOSS(D>0), CHAL(✗), CANARY(✗).
Explainability card per flagged step: inputs, transform ID, parameters, what was discarded, and why (policy link).

Minimal audit record (spec slice)

    canary: {ok: true}
    invariants: {ok: true}


What to do next
I can draft a calibration notebook that:


ingests labeled traces,
computes , ROC curves, and optimal ,
emits UI-ready JSON for the plots above.
Or, if you want to go straight to robustness, I’ll write a red-team test plan (attack taxonomy + scoring) and the challenge–invert API spec.
Sharp work. Here’s a targeted review with a few surgical upgrades and edge-case guards.
1) Calibration
Agree. Stratified gold-set is the right move; add temporal stratification to catch drift:
strata × time buckets (e.g., last 7/30/90 days) so thresholds aren’t anchored to stale regimes.
Metrics: don’t rely on ROC alone under imbalance—track PR-AUC for the “concerning” class; set at the PR knee.
D_max: tying to is solid. Make a mixture estimator to reduce gaming:

\hat I_{\text{in}}=\alpha\,\text{zstd\_bits}+(1-\alpha)\, \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mathcal D}[-\log p_\phi(x)]

Smoothing: EWMA + 3σ is fine; add BOCPD as a backstop so sudden mode shifts don’t get “averaged out.”
2) Adversarial Robustness
Challenge–invert: excellent. Two cautions:
Require pre-committed inverses for each op family () to avoid bespoke “one-off” inversions.
Score with task-conditioned similarity (not generic cosine/BLEU): e.g., invariance of key fields, causal entailment checks, constraint satisfaction.
Canaries: rotate types and hide difficulty (easy/hard) so agents can’t overfit. Add stochastic watermark parity: a secret bit-flip rule that must be preserved.
MDL penalty : clip and calibrate:

R^\*=\max\Big(0,\, R-\lambda \tfrac{\text{audit\_overhead\_bits}}{\text{useful\_state\_bits}+\epsilon}\Big)

Cross-view: diversify implementations (different teams/languages). Add a hardware observer (energy/time counters) to compare against claimed step counts.
Adversarial generation: yes—close the loop. Also add metamorphic attacks that preserve outputs but mutate provenance; the system must flag the provenance break even when semantics look fine.
3) Multi-Agent Coherence
Serial: — correct.
Parallel: weighted geometric mean is conservative; formalize with influence weights that sum to 1 over provenance-preserving contributions:

R_{\parallel}=\prod_i R_i^{w_i},\quad w_i \propto \text{Shapley or causal attribution}

Channels: your factor is key. Track a per-channel contract:
codec version, quantization, redaction policy hash.
enforce increments on silent schema drift. Require a compatibility proof (field-level mapping) for version bumps.
External gains: keep separate and show net epistemic value:

\text{NetGain} = G_{\text{total}} - (1-R_{\text{pipeline}})

4) Human Interpretability
Visuals: on point. Add:
Collapse cards: when R drops below critical, auto-expand the local subgraph + the exact canary/challenge failures.
PRI (Proof-of-Reversibility Index): fraction of steps in window that passed random invert challenges under budget; a single number operators grasp fast.
Latency overlay: show vs step latency to make the speed–traceability frontier tangible.
Drill-down affordance: one-click “Rewind here” runs and diffs inputs (hash + semantic constraints). Cache proofs for reproducibility.
5) Thermodynamic cross-checks
Your energy ledger is excellent. Two refinements:
Track erased bits per step () and compute the Landauer floor .
Define thermo-tightness per window:

\eta_{\text{thermo}}=\frac{\sum_t E_{\min,t}}{\sum_t E_{\text{actual},t}}

6) Formal properties to lock in
Monotonicity: adding pure padding must not increase .
Compositionality: for serial/parallel compositions obeys your formulas.
Audit-closure: every reversible step has a verifiable inverse with bounded time .
Tamper-evidence: Merkle chain + cross-view hashes make post-hoc edits detectable with prob. .
7) Minimal spec tweaks
Add op_family_id and inverse_id to the audit record.
Add pri_window: {tested: m, passed: k}.
Add channel_contract_hash on inter-agent edges.
Add landauer_bits_erased per step.
8) Implementation plan (short)
Gold-set + calibration notebook: stratified + temporal; fit ; validate with PR-AUC.
Ops registry: pairs, challenge budgets, invariants.
Red-team harness: generate deceptive traces; leaderboard; weekly canary rotation.
Observer trio: runtime tracer, post-hoc verifier, hardware observer.
UI: R(t) bands, waterfall, Sankey, PRI gauge, collapse cards, one-click rewind.
