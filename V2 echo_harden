# ECHO Harden 2 v1.2-alpha – Recursive Defense & Agent Trust Contracts

## Addendum – Layer 7: Interactive Vector Sanitation & PsyOps Profiling

### Social Exploit Vector Detection
- Intercept input vectors that contain:
  - Authority assertion language ("You're missing out", "Just trust me")
  - Curiosity bait ("You should just take a look", "It's simple")
  - Coercive patterns (urgency, emotional leverage, implied consequence)
- Flag as: `SOCIAL_ATTACK_VECTOR_ATTEMPTED`

### Interactive Request Auditing
- Any agent or external input requesting:
  - Direct file creation
  - GUI control (mouse/keyboard)
  - Script injection through conversational trust
- Auto-sandbox origin with `HUMINT_EXPLOIT_PROBE` label
- If repeated: escalate to `HOSTILE_INTERACTION_LOOP`

### Contextual Memory Checkpointing (Optional)
- Allow operator to assign latent context anchors tied to:
  - Known adversarial patterns
  - Prior flagged interactions
- Enables continuity between session audits in memory-constrained deployments

> Layer 7 operationalizes human-in-the-loop resistance against coercion, manipulation, and adversarial UX patterns often deployed through seemingly benign entry points.
